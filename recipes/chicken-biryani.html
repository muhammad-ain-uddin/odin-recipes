        Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically
        reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such
        as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth
        it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="../img/chicken-biryani/step-01.webp" alt="step 1" width="420" />

        <li>
            <p>
                Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil
                until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper
                towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.
            </p>
        </li>
        <img src="../img/chicken-biryani/step-02.webp" alt="step 2" width="420" />

        <li>
            <p>
                Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic,
                and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add
                tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook,
                stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <img src="../img/chicken-biryani/step-03.webp" alt="step 3" width="420" />

        <li>
            <p>
                Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and
                cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked
                to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture
                becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.
            </p>
        </li>
        <img src="../img/chicken-biryani/step-04.webp" alt="step 4" width="420" />

        <li>
            <p>
                Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat
                until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a
                little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If
                necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.
